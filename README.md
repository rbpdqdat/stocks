# Introduction

Using Python to pull stock data and create charts.  The initial program uses the [yahoo-finance](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.1.4) python module to get stock data from yahoo.  There is a delay in the quotes and more information about what type of data that can be viewed is explaing in the link above.

The initial goal is to look at a few stocks and possibly create a web interface that will pull stock data and perform some statistical methods to determine the likelyhood of stocks moving in one direction over another.
